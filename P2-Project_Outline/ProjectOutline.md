# Project Outline
### Overview
Activist Hub would provide clients a one stop space for organizing and activism. In the field, at a action, even during a normal day of canvasing an organizer can find themselves in need of immediate resources. This could be a quick alteration of a meeting place, communications to comrades within your organization, our a specific list of contact and direct links to recourses one could possibly need while organizing, canvasing, or attending an action. As an activist and organizer myself, the creation of apps like NextDoor and Signal make organizing protest, canvases, and meetings are now easier. Activist Hub would combine and expand on the services provided by the already established applications. The specific mission is to provide activists with a one-stop space that would not only help you to communicate very sensitive information, as well as staying connected to resources such as a bail project for activist whom are arrested during protest. I believe that this app would provide and become a well needed, secure tool that will ease the tiring workload an activists or organizer may endure on a daily basis.
